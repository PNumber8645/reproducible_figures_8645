# reproducible_figures_8645
Hello! 
On my Repository, you should find a markdown document to see my reproducible figures code. I have also uploaded the raw penguins CSV file, to see the initial data, and an extra 
r script of some of the funcitons i used during data cleaning. 
I hope everything runs smoothly! 

(this work has been created for P number 9591 to check and run my code for the Open Science question)
